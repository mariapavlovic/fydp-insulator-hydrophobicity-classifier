Automate classification of insulator defects (loss of hydrophobicity) with deep learning

## 1.1 Motivation

There is a dwindling number of people in the power engineering workforce, and this downward trend in professionals has put a noticeable strain on the industry [1]. This strain is further exacerbated with the shift to silicone rubber insulators—such insulators necessitate a minimum level of expertise to validate its condition, and due to the workforce shortage may prove difficult in different areas [2].

This introduces a case where high-caliber experience is needed but is not easily or quickly sourced. Thanks to the strides made in deep-learning models, there is the potential to leverage the use of apps and photo recognition to make classifying the insulators easier and more accessible. This would eliminate the barrier of entry to silicone insulator upkeep and replace it with a more convenient, intuitive method that does not solely depend on the availability and expertise of utility engineers.

## 1.2 Project Objective

The objective is to automate the hydrophobicity classification process of polymer insulators to allow for faster, easier, and more reliable classification. This would result in a more accessible approach to polymer insulator maintenance and boost its viability in regions originally not equipped with the right expertise.
